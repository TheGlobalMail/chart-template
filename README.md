###Chart template

Template to automate some steps for making iframe charts for TGM stories.

1. `npm install`
2. check what you're doing with `http-server`
3. `grunt build` to minify/concatenate your css/js, and update html file accordingly

Right now this just contains a highcharty stacked bar chart made for use in a story.
